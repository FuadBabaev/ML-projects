# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This collection showcases various projects that demonstrate my skills in data processing, machine learning model training, and deployment. Each project is designed to solve specific data-driven problems using state-of-the-art tools and techniques.

## Projects

### 1. [Smoker Status Prediction](Smoker_status_prediction)
- **Original Contest:** [Kaggle - Smoker Status Prediction using Biosignals](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/smoker-status-prediction-using-biosignals/data)
- **Description:** This project aims to predict smoker status using biosignal data. It involves extensive use of dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE, PCA, and UMAP, followed by classification using LightGBM.
- **Technologies:** t-SNE, PCA, UMAP, LightGBM

### 2. [Credit Risk Model Stability](Credit_risk_model_stablitity)
- **Original Contest:** [Kaggle - Home Credit Credit Risk Model Stability](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability/overview)
- **Description:** This project focuses on building a stable credit risk model. The experiments are tracked using MLflow, ensuring reproducibility and systematic tuning of LightGBM models.
- **Technologies:** LightGBM, MLflow

### 3. [Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction](Google_Analytics_Customer_Revenue)
- **Original Contest:** [Kaggle - Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data)
- **Description:** The project involves preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of customer revenue data. The data is then saved in Parquet format for efficient storage and retrieval. A basic LightGBM model is implemented initially, followed by an advanced ensemble approach combining LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost models.
- **Technologies:** EDA, Parquet, LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost
